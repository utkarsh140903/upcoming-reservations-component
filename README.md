This React project showcases a responsive "Upcoming Reservations" component that displays reservations using static JSON data. The design accommodates both desktop and mobile views and includes basic interactivity for managing reservations.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, as it provides the necessary runtime for running JavaScript outside the browser. Check your node installation with:

```sh
node -v
```

### Installation

```powershell
cd "C:\Users\91638\OneDrive\Desktop\ReactApp\Frontend Developer task"
```

2. Install the necessary packages:

npm install
```

### Running the Project

Start the application in development mode:

```powershell
npm start
```

This will automatically:
- Set the required Node.js compatibility flags
- Start the development server
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your web browser to view the component

**Note:** The project is configured to work with newer Node.js versions automatically.

### Usage
